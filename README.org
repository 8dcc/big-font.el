* Customizing

The following variables can be customized.

- Variable: big-font-faces ::

  List of elements ~(FACE HEIGHT FAMILY)~ used by =big-font-mode=.

  Each entry will be used for overwriting the =:height= and =:family= properties of
  the specified FACE using =set-face-attribute=. The =FACE= should be a symbol, the
  =HEIGHT= an integer, and the =FAMILY= a string.

  Note that the =FACE= is mandatory, but the =HEIGHT= and =FAMILY= are both optional
  and can be =nil=.

  By default, this variable configured to simply set the height of the default
  font to 120 (i.e. 12pt).
